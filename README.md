Task 2: AI Content Marketing & UGC Ad Pack
Industry: Luxury Beauty & Wellness

Brand: Aura & Edge (Sustainable Boutique Salon)

1. Project Overview
The objective of this task was to develop a high-conversion Content Marketing Strategy using AI to bridge the gap between premium brand identity and authentic social media presence.

The Problem
Luxury brands often struggle with Social Proof. Traditional high-end advertisements can feel "cold" or "fake," leading to low engagement on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Aura & Edge needed a way to showcase their sustainable practices and premium results through the lens of a "real customer" without losing their sophisticated brand voice.

The Solution
I engineered a series of prompts to generate a UGC (User-Generated Content) Pack. This system produces viral-ready hooks, relatable problem-solution scripts, and cross-platform adaptations. By using Contextual Priming and Sensory Language, the AI creates content that feels human, trustworthy, and aesthetically aligned with "Slow Beauty."

2. Prompt 1:"Act as a Viral Content Strategist. I need 5 high-engagement 'Hooks' for an Instagram Reel/TikTok promoting 'Aura & Edge' salon. The goal is to stop the scroll for people interested in sustainable luxury. Hooks should include:
A 'POV' style hook.
A 'Secret/Discovery' style hook.
A 'Transformation' teaser.
A 'Controversial/Opinion' hook about hair health.
A 'Day in the life' hook."

Prompt logic:
1. Viral Hook Generator Logic
Framework: Pattern Interruption & Persona Prompting.

Role-Play: By assigning the role of a "Viral Content Strategist," the AI prioritizes algorithms (engagement) over just "nice writing."

Variable Injection: Specifying five different types of hooks (POV, Secret, Transformation, etc.) ensures the output covers various Psychological Triggers.

Targeting: Using the constraint "Sustainable Luxury" prevents the AI from generating "cheap" or "discount" sounding hooks, keeping the brand premium.

AI Output:
1. POV Hook
“POV: You finally choose hair health over trends—and it changes everything.”
Why it works: Speaks directly to the viewer’s mindset and invites self-reflection, a proven high-engagement trigger.
2. Secret / Discovery Hook
“Most salons won’t tell you this… your color routine could be aging your hair.”
Why it works: Creates curiosity and positions Aura & Edge as informed, honest, and elevated.
3. Transformation Teaser
“This isn’t just a balayage—watch what happens when hair is treated slowly.”
Why it works: Reframes transformation as health-driven, not just visual, encouraging viewers to watch till the end.
4. Controversial / Opinion Hook
“Hot take: healthy hair should outlast the trend.”
Why it works: Gentle controversy sparks comments without sounding aggressive or off-brand.
5. Day-in-the-Life Hook
“A day inside a salon where nothing is rushed—not even the color.”
Why it works: Signals exclusivity and calm, appealing to viewers craving an escape from fast beauty culture.

3.Prompt 2:"Write a 45-second UGC video script for a customer of Aura & Edge. Scenario: A customer who was tired of harsh chemical smells and dry hair from traditional salons. Structure: > - Hook: Use one of the hooks generated above.
Body: Mention the 'Botanical Scalp Treatment' and 'Organic Coloring.' Describe the sensory experience (smell, feel).
CTA: Invite viewers to 'link in bio' for a first-time consultation. Tone: Authentic, relaxed, and aesthetically pleasing. Include visual cues like [Close up of hair shine] or [Pouring organic tea]."

Prompt logic:
2. Problem-Solution UGC Script Logic
Framework: Narrative Priming & Sensory Detailing.
Storytelling: Instead of asking for a general ad, the prompt provides a specific Pain Point (chemical smells/dry hair). This creates a relatable narrative for the target audience.
Multi-Modal Direction: By requesting "Visual Cues" (e.g., [Close up of hair shine]), I am directing the AI to think in Scenes, not just words. This makes the output "production-ready" for a content creator.
Tone Control: Specifying "Authentic and Relaxed" ensures the AI avoids the "Radio Host" voice, which often kills performance in User-Generated Content (UGC).

AI Output:
[Hook – Front camera, soft daylight]
“POV: You finally choose hair health over trends—and it changes everything.”
[Cut to salon interior | ambient music]
I used to leave salons with that strong chemical smell in my hair—and honestly, my scalp always felt tight and dry after.
[Close-up: stylist massaging scalp]
Then I found Aura & Edge. The first thing I noticed? The smell.
It’s clean, botanical… almost spa-like.
[Visual: Pouring organic tea | steam rising]
I tried their Botanical Scalp Treatment, and it felt grounding—cool, soothing, no burning, no heaviness.
[Close-up of organic color being mixed]
They also use organic coloring, which blew my mind.
No harsh fumes. My hair felt soft while it was processing.
[Close up of hair shine | slow motion hair flip]
And this is the result—healthy, shiny, and it actually feels better than before.
[Mirror selfie smile | calm background]
If you’re tired of dry hair and chemical overload, this place is such a reset.
[CTA – Text on screen + soft smile]
Check the link in bio and book a first-time consultation.
Your hair—and scalp—will thank you.

4. Prompt 3:"Adapt the script above for Pinterest Idea Pins. Instead of a long script, give me 4 text-overlay slides that tell the story of a 'Sustainable Hair Glow-up' at Aura & Edge. Focus on 'Aesthetic' and 'Minimalist' keywords."

Prompt logic:
3. Platform Adaptation (The Remix) Logic
Framework: Cross-Channel Optimization & Constraint-Based Prompting.
Constraint Implementation: By shifting from a "Script" to "4 Text-Overlay Slides," the prompt forces the AI to be succinct and punchy.
Algorithmic Matching: Pinterest is a visual search engine, not a social feed. The logic here was to switch focus to "Minimalist Keywords" and "Aesthetics," matching the user intent of Pinterest (inspiration) vs. TikTok (entertainment).

AI Output:
Slide 1 — The Problem (Hook)

Text Overlay:
“A sustainable hair glow-up starts with less chemicals.”

Visual Cue:
Soft natural light · neutral tones · close-up of textured hair

Slide 2 — The Shift

Text Overlay:
“Organic color. Botanical rituals. Nothing rushed.”

Visual Cue:
Organic color being mixed · glass bowls · slow hands

Slide 3 — The Experience

Text Overlay:
“Clean scent. Calm scalp. Quiet luxury.”

Visual Cue:
Scalp massage · steam · linen towels · minimal décor

Slide 4 — The Result

Text Overlay:
“Healthy shine is the new glow-up.”

Visual Cue:
[Close-up of hair shine] · soft movement · effortless finish

5.Conclusion:
The successful execution of this task demonstrates how Prompt Engineering functions as a bridge between high-level brand strategy and day-to-day content creation. By engineering a modular content pack for Aura & Edge, I have achieved the following:
Authenticity at Scale: Proved that AI can generate "human-centric" UGC scripts that maintain a luxury brand’s prestige while meeting the demand for authentic social proof.
Algorithmic Versatility: Showed how structured prompts allow for immediate repurposing of content across different platforms (Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest) without losing the core brand message.
Strategic Impact: Established a system that doesn't just "write text," but solves specific marketing challenges like scroll-retention and customer trust through psychological triggers and sensory details.
